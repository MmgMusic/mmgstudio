To pay tribute to the 4th generation, I composed a Latin-style track that closely resembles the music from that era. I used almost the same instruments as the game to give the composition that original Nintendo DS feel. Many instruments \"converse\" with each other, which is typical of Pokémon city themes like Jubilife City! This track is sunnier, and you can imagine it as an alternative theme for Sunyshore City. Following the Pokémon tradition, I also created a modern remake, titled \"Spotimon (Radiant Jade Version)\".",
